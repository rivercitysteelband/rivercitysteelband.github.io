#About

The Rivercity Steel Band is a community steel band playing Caribbean style music. We aim to:

* Provide opportunities for people to learn music and to be part of a band.
* Promote the incredible and unique musical phenomenon of Steel Bands, as well as Caribbean culture.
* Learn and perform Steel Band music.

Membership is open to people of all ages from all walks of life and musical ability. There is no need to be able to read music and tuition is provided. The band performs regularly at various locations around Southeast Queensland including Brisbane City Council parks and CBD locations, local markets, festivals, and school events, Queensland Multicultural Festival and the Ipswich Festival. We rehearse as West End State School.

Member fees are kept low in order to attract people from the community, especially those with disadvantage, which is traditionally the target membership of steel bands both in Trinidad and elsewhere in the world. Being a member of a steel band is a discipline which provides a rewarding sense of fulfillment and achievement, and a sense of belonging both to the band and to the wider, tight knit pan playing community.

The origin of steel bands lies in Trinidad where the discovery that oil drums could be hammered and tuned to make musical instruments was made. The basic instrument is the steel pan, or drum, which is made in a range of different sizes to match the range of notes of the instruments of an orchestra. Formerly associated with poverty, the steel pan is now officially recognised as the National Instrument of Trinidad and Tobago and has millions of players and followers throughout the world.

Steel pan music was introduced to Australia in the 1970s when Amral Khan’s Cavaliers Steel Bands toured the world and made several visits to Australia. A number of its members decided to stay, including Alvin Rostant, who later teamed up with Paul Santiago and formed the [Australian Academy of Steel Drums](www.steeldrums.org).

The Rivercity Steel Band evolved from one of the Academy’s workshops and was formed in 2008. Alvin is music director and brings a wealth of experience to the band. Alvin is an well known professional musician who performs solo, with his band, Jahbutu, and provides a range of workshops including the Banana Joe schools program.
